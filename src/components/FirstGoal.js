                        <p>Extreme Programming (XP) is about social change. It is about letting
                            go of habits and patterns that were adaptive in the past, but now get in
                            the way of us doing our best work. It is about giving up the defenses
                            that protect us but interfere with our productivity. It may leave us feel-
                            ing exposed.Good relationships lead to good business. Productivity and conﬁ-
                            dence are related to our human relationships in the workplace as well as
                            to our coding or other work activities. You need both technique and
                            good relationships to be successful. XP addresses both.
                            Prepare for success. Don’t protect yourself from success by holding
                            back. Do your best and then deal with the consequences. That’s
                            extreme. You leave yourself exposed. For some people that is incredi-
                            bly scary, for others it’s daily life. That is why there are such polarized
                            reactions to XP.</p>
