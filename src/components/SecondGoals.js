                        Parallels with other disciplines have to be applied with care. What
                        works on the manufacturing ﬂoor may not work in the programming
                        room and vice versa. However, other disciplines have been working on
                        difﬁcult people problems, like encouraging organizational change, for
                        decades. Understanding the lessons they have learned can help acceler-
