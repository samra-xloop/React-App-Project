                        choose different practices to meet those conditions. Your values do not
                        have to change in order to adapt to a new situation. Some new princi-

                        to aim for perfection, provide you with clear goals, and give you practical
                        ways to get there. The practices are a vector from where you are to where
                        you can be with XP. In XP, you make progress towards this ideal state of

                        sense if you only deploy once a year. Successfully deploying more fre-
